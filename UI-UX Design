 CLEAN AND SIMPLE
1) Establishing Visual Hierarchy 

- Define where user will look first
- Define main message 
- Formulate a flow that corresponds to the content's message == lead the user where you want him/her to go
- Decide the relationship between each section and use whitespace to represent that

2) ICONs
- used as guides for content points
- are always labled
- use vector icons (scalable) not static images

3) Images
- use SVG pictures as much as possible instead of just simple colors and static images

4) Fonts
- Bigger font--> smaller font size
- preffere sans serif
